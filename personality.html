						"More than just sociable people-pleasers, ENFP personalities are
						shaped by their Intuitive (N) quality, allowing them to read between the lines with curiosity and energy. They tend
						to see life as a big, complex puzzle where everything is connected - but unlike Analyst personality types, who tend
						to see that puzzle as a series of systemic machinations, Campaigners see it through a prism of emotion, compassion
						and mysticism, and are always looking for a deeper meaning".

						If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still.

						You are a confident problem solver. You take time to understand the problem, understand the criteria for a good decision, and generate some good options. Because you approach problems systematically, you cover the essentials each time - and your decisions are well though out, well planned, and well executed. You can continue to perfect your problem-solving skills and use them for continuous improvement initiatives within your organization.

						<p class="cursive">
						At the age of 33 I am starting to become familiar with my character traits and due to this, these tests were not much of a surprise to me. The results of the Myers Briggs Test revealed some important points to me regarding my character, most importantly that I should take care not to get frustrated when things don't move quickly enough and be considerate when working closely with people. Experience has taught me that I am a good leader and will gladly take the reins if handed them but find I am often happier as a pillar of support to the person in charge.
