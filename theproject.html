							HUNTmap - Hardware Universal Networking Topological map.
							</p>
									<p>
Software designed to connect with any type of hardware, allowing the user to simultaneously manage all systems.
Designed with user versatility in mind, HUNTmap delivers a graphic user interface that knows no limitation unless required by the end user. Many platforms exist based around network management, but versatility is usually limited. With this in mind, HUNTmap is geared towards not just the IT professional but the Enterprise, and can scale to as large or small an application as required. Combined with this, HUNTmap allows for complete customization of its Graphic User Interface (GUI) and user level privilege restrictions to ensure only relevant information is seen depending on the deployment.

							Motivation
							<br>
							<br>

HUNTmap is a solution to a fundamental problem unique to the age of technology wherein many different back end systems operate on proprietary software platforms and no integration is provided to allow systems to communicate with one another. For example, take a large business like a city council. Councils have numerous different departments and technologies employed and managed, such as waste and water infrastructure, building management systems, security, surveillance, lifts and data networks but with no combined platform to manage and control all. HUNTmap's creation is necessitated by limit of universal integration platforms available and the sheer lack of customization available therein. HUNTmap excels at being a one stop shop for whatever the application, whether it be a global enterprise business, or a single smart home solution.

							Description
							<br>
							<br>
The HUNTmap system exists in its simplest form as a software application running on a network-based server. Communication to field devices is fundamentally through IP interface, though other technologies are available if required. User interface is provided by a client program which can either run on the same machine as the server for a small installation, or client workstations on the broader network. 'Edge Servers' are sometimes required to provide either standalone operation at a remote site or device end integration by means of serial or USB connection.
          					<br>
          					HUNTmap at its core is a Network Management System, initially designed for the Network Engineer to provide a more graphical orientated means of viewing topology. It is based around the idea that interactive icons representing monitored devices reside on a graphical map overlay and can be context clicked to interact with or gather data not displayed. Device connections can be drawn in as per physical interface and will display in real time the traffic flow per VLAN on the interface and even give visual indication of current Spanning Tree topology.
          					<br>
          					Further to this universal device, configuration could be controlled by the software. Once device information is imported, HUNTmap can store saved configs and even provide changes to entire networks configuration at a single mouse click. Added to this, if a legacy device is not supported, a unique Command Line Interface API can be configured per device to provide high level control. This methodology is built upon to allow almost limitless integration with any device or system and dramatically expands the uses and practicality HUNTmap provides.
          					<br>
          					Network IO control modules are also included in the HUNTmap family allowing a further level of versatility. These devices can be used for anything from controlling lights, overriding access doors, alarm sounders and HUNTmap can even completely replace security alarm and access control systems.  It encompasses a multitude of options for hardware "high level" and "low level" interface including SNMP, BACnet, SSL, Telnet, ASCII and various preset and configurable API', allowing all networks to display and interact within the same user interface.
          					<br>
          					Deployment of the GUI is extremely versatile as well, with the ability to utilize an integrator level application view for IT and systems managers as well as a very limited web-based GUI for site specific systems supervision. Application for this would be a mining site, although part of a larger organization, supervision, maintenance and control of systems is still required locally from the specific site. A mine site might have a high-risk piece of machinery where telemetry can be fed straight into HUNTmap and managed locally from a custom Graphic User Interface showing only relevant systems. Emergency evacuation can also be controlled automatically by HUNTmap, triggering electronic egress, evac lighting and warning sirens on certain predefined critical conditions.
          					<br>
          					HUNTmap can even be used at a 'smart home' solution. Existing electrical appliances can be controlled by the deployment of Wifi Smart IO controllers, eliminating the need for expensive rewiring. Tablet and smartphone support via customizable applications can also be used to view data, control lights and doors or even arm and disarm areas when utilised for security purposes

							Tools and Technologies
							<br>
							<br>
Although an elaborate project, HUNTmap will initially be developed based on existing open source application 'Jnetmap'. This application provides an appropriate foundation for HUNTmap's core methodology although very lacking in its current form. Collaboration with Jnetmap's developer will be required to avoid copyright infringement. Sourcing will also be required for an appropriate vendor of a generic network-based IO controller, as well as research into interfacing with the device. Testing of existing Wifi based smart home solutions would be carried out to see if control of devices and integration to HUNTmap is possible. Obtaining different makes of ethernet switches and hardware is required to research successful integration with external devices.

							Skill Required
							<br>
							<br>
Skills for completion of this project vary wildly but initially software development - namely in Java - is a fundamental requirement. As the plan is to base this application on Jnetmap, development could be shared with Jnetmap's creator if willing. As this is a very large project, feasibility on a small budget is questionable but the aim should be to create a smaller proof-of-concept version of the product to gather industry attention and potentially investment. Experience with electronics is also required and could be filled at this stage by myself as I have extensive experience working in the electronic security sector. Network experience is also within my skill set and will suffice to get this project to a proof-of-concept stage.

							Outcome
							<br>
							<br>
Successful completion of this project would see a very powerful tool given to many industries, allowing them to provide a uniquely customised means of interfacing with their product. Organizations with vast infrastructure as mentioned will be able to not only converge the monitoring of their systems but allow for greater user end control, increased system up-time and overall quality of life improvement. This product is conceived as a stand-alone application, meaning it does not require proprietary hardware to run. Also, it is purposed to bridge the gap between many different industries allowing each to provide a standalone solution and/or integrate with accompanying systems.
