									Nathan - Swiss Army Knife - Christos resides in beautiful sunny Queensland where he tirelessly tackles the world’s electronic security and surveillance issues. He is never afraid to get his hands dirty and always hungry to learn something not yet known. Born in Australia with European heritage, Nathan spent his early years far from the IT world, growing up amongst the farming communities in mid NSW. Home schooled from an early age, he was noted at being years above the requirement of his curriculum but sadly, didn’t continue his vocational journey through to university until recently when he started studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. Nathan has always had a strong desire to learn anything unfamiliar throughout his life, mastering many crafts from archery to knitting and even Rubik’s cube solving.									</p>
