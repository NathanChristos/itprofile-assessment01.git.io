											My interest in technology was awakened with the arrival of my family's first computer. A roaring 8mb of ram and an integrated turbo button saw me exploring the wonders of MS Paint and Encarta Encyclopedia; I was fascinated by what I imagined was inner voodoo witchcraft taking place within this strange box. Many years later, a friend would brag about his 'computer building' skills, and for me, the illusion was broken. Building is an art, I thought, a craft; builders create something from nothing. Prior to that day I had imagined computers being brought to life one capacitor, diode and resistor at a time in a mysterious dark lab just outside of reality. But now I could see that computers weren't magical; they were modular, and quite within my understanding. So I had to know more. Fast forward to today and I still crave a deeper understanding. A career in electronics has only fueled my desire to explore the fundamentals of computational processing and machine language, so inevitably my journey found me enrolling with RMIT to study Information Technology. My mission is to possess the knowledge and skills needed to develop any one of many inventive projects I have mentally conceived.
