											<article class="post"> <p>Nathan - Nathan’s interest in technology was awakened with the
																				arrival of his families first computer. A roaring 8mb of
																				ram and an integrated turbo button saw him exploring the
																				wonders of MS Paint and Encarta Encyclopedia fascinated by
																				the inner voodoo witchcraft taking place within this
																				strange box. Many years later a friend would brag about his
																				‘computer building’ skills but for Nathan, the illusion was
																				broken. Building is an art, a craft, builders create
																				something from nothing. Prior to that day he had imagined
																				computers being brought to life one capacitor, diode and
																				resistor at a time in a mysterious dark lab just outside of
																				reality. He wondered why the term building was used when
																				computers essentially went together piece by piece like
																				Lego. So he had to know more. Fast forward to today and he
																				still craves a deeper understanding. A career in
																				electronics had only fueled the desire to explore the
																				fundamentals of computational processing and machine
																				language so inevitably his journey found him enrolling with
																				RMIT to study information technology. Nathans mission is to
																				possess the knowledge and skills needed to develop any one
																				of many inventive projects he has conceived. </p> <br> <a
