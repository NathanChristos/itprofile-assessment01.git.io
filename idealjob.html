- is a diverse role requiring a creative person who possesses the ability to think outside the box with extensive experience in many different technologies and platforms. The appeal of this role for me is that it represents innovation and allows for development of never-before-seen applications of technology. I would find this job very attractive due to the apparent diverse range of technologies being developed for and integrated with. Although not fluent in much in the way of programming, with my minimal knowledge, I can certainly see an easy path to meeting the criteria required. During my time at RMIT, I will endeavor to dig deeply into the world of computer science and software development, not just to achieve a 'degree', but to understand it as if it were a second language. I have a proven history in relation to "dev wisdom", as in my previous careers I have mastered logic in terms of weighing up pros and cons. For example: fast vs efficient or effective vs affordable.  I believe with the appropriate training and experience and prerequisite skills, I could excel in a role such as this; I have a very creative and logical mind, and possesses very strong problem solving skills developed through my career in electronics.															</p>
